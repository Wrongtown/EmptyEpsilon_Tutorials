What is this?
=============
I hope to develop some tutorial missions for Empty Epsilon but I figure that the scripts and any assets I create for them should probably be able to be added in to an existing copy of the game rather than bundled for every download.


What is EmptyEpsilon?
=====================
It's a Spaceship Bridge Simulator game inspired by Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator. The code can be found at https://github.com/daid/EmptyEpsilon and compiled versions deemed ready for Release are available at http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/#tabs=5

I strongly encourage you to give it a try and if you are able to contribute please do. They're doing great work with this project and it really can be a lot of fun. Even if you are failing to meet the victory conditions for the game it can be hilarious as the chaos unfolds, so even when you lose, you win.


How do I use this?
==================
For now, all you have to do is save the .lua files into the \scripts directory under the main Empty Epsilon directory (there will already be several .lua files there), and when you next run the game you'll see tutorial missions available.


How can I help?
===============
Not a lot at the moment, by all means check out the scripts and if you have enhancements or efficiency improvements to suggest then feel free to create a Pull Request and present them. If daid et al. decide what I do here is worthy of being included each time then I'll retire this repository, but I suspect it's better this way.

The best thing you can do is to go contribute directly to the game itself.
